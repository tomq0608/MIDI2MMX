# MIDI2MMX
This a project is focused on initially converting a midi file into programming positions destined for the MMX to play.

I sugggest we have two branches 

branch a used when magnets are used

branch b used when the rivets are used

Please if you are adding features pull the project from master, branch the project (name the branch something to do with your feature) and request a push when your stuff is working :).
